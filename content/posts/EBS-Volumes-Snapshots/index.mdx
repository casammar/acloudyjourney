### EBS Volumes Overview
- EBS = virtual hard disk drive in the cloud
- Snapshots exist on S3
- Snapshots are incremental, only changes data is stored to S3
- Volumes will **ALWAYS** be in the same region as the EC@ instance
- You can change the volume type and/or size **"on the fly"** without shutting down or terminating your volume
- If you terminate EC2 instance by default root volume is terminated, additional volumes will persist

### How to move EBS to another availability zone??
1. Take snapshot of EBS Volumes
2. Turn snapshot into AMI
3. Luanch instance from AMI, choose which availability zone (subnet) to deploy in

### How to move EBS to another region??

### Instance Store Volumes
- Instance Store Volumes = Ephemeral Storage
- Instance Store Volumes can't be stopped, if host fails you **WILL** lose data
- EBS back instances can be stopped, will **NOT** lose data if stopped
- Can reboot both, will not lose data
- By default, both **ROOT** volumes will be deleted on termination.
- With EBS volumes, can set instance termination behavior to not delete
