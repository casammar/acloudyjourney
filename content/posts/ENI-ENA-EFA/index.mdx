description: Comparing different types of network adapters for EC2 instances
tags:
  - EC2
  - Networking

1. **Elastic Network Interface (ENI)** - essentially just a virtual networking card. Comes default with EC2 instances.
    - Use Cases:
    - management network
    - seperate network and security appliances in your VPC
    - dual-home instances with workloads/roles on different subnets
    - create low-budget, high availability solution
2. **Enhanced Networking** - uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high networking capabilities on supported instance types.
    - higher bandwidth, higher packets per second, lower inter-instance latencies. 
    - no additional charge, but must be on **supported instance types**
    - **use where you want good network performance**
    - **Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)** - supports speeds up to **100Gbps**
    - **Virtual Function (VF)** - Intel 82599 supports speeds up to **10Gbps**
    - **If given option choose ENA over VF on exam**
3. **Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)** - network device that you can attach to EC2 instance to accelerate **High Performance Computing (HPC)** and **machine learning applications** 
    - EFA provides lower latency and higher throughput than TCP transport used in tradtional HPC systems
    - uses OS-bypass to bypass OS kernal and communicate directly with EFA device
    - **used mainly for machine learning applications**
    - **Not supported on windows, only linux**
