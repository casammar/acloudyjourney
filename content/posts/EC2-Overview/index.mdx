    1. Standard Reserved
    2. Convertible Reserved - can convert between different EC2 instance type familys
    3. Scheduled Reserved - available to launch within certain time windows (schools)
3. **Spot** - price changes with capacity, you set your bid price
    * If you terminate instance you are charged for full hour
    * If Amazon terminates instance you are not charged for full hour
4. **Dedicated Hosts** - dedicated EC2 server
    * good for server-bound software licenses (oracle)

### Launching Instances
- Termination protection is **turned off** by default
