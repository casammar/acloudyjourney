## IAM Service
**IAM allows you to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.**

### Features
- Centralized control of your AWS account
- Shared access to your AWS account
- Granular permissions
- Identity Federation (active directory, FB, linkedin, etc)
- Multifactor Authentication
- Integrates with many different AWS services
- Supports PCI DSS Compliance
- Use access key ID and secret access key to make programatic requests to AWS

### Terminology
1. Users - end users such as people or employees of organizations
2. Groups - collection of users. Each user in the group will inherit the permissions of the group
3. Policis - JSON formatted documents that give permissions as to what a user/group/role is able to do
4. Roles - You can creat roles then assign them to AWS Resources
