  Hi.
</Text>

I'm Chris - I started this site as a technical journal dedicated to documenting my <span style="text-transform: uppercase;font-weight: bold;font-size: 1.25;background-color: #f0ff00;padding: 5px;font-style: italic;">journey</span> through learning cloud technologies. The goal is to document key points and reminders as I progress through this expedition in hopes that if I write down what I am learning I will be more likely to remember it. The end goal here is to obtain my AWS certification (SAA-C02) to become a <span style="text-transform: uppercase;font-weight: bold;font-size: 1.25;background-color: #f0ff00;padding: 5px;font-style: italic;">certified solutions architect</span>. Hopefully this will be the first of many under the AWS certification umbrella.
