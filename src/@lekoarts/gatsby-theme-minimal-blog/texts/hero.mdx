  Hi.

I'm Chris - I started this site as a daily affirmation journal dedicated to my journey in learning cloud technologies. The goal is to document key points and reminders as I progress through this expedition in hopes that if I write down what I am learning I will be more likely to remember it. The end goal to obtain my AWS certification as a solutions architect. Hopefully this will be the first of many under the AWS certification umbrella.
