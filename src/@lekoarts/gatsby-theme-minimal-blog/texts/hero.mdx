  Hi.

I'm Chris - I started this site as an affirmation journal dedicated to my <Text sx={{ fontSize: 4, fontWeight: `bold` }}>journey</Text> through learning cloud technologies. The goal is to document key points and reminders as I progress through this expedition in hopes that if I write down what I am learning I will be more likely to remember it. The end goal here is to obtain my AWS certification (SAA-C02) as a <Text sx={{ fontSize: 4, fontWeight: `bold` }}>solutions architect</Text>. Hopefully this will be the first of many under the AWS certification umbrella.
